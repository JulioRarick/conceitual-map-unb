# ConceptMap Project

This project is a concept map created for a college assignment. It uses Next.js 14 with the App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Aceternity UI. The concept map covers the initial concepts presented in the course, including Education, Necropolitics, Abortion, and Political Control.

## Course Outline

**Course Title**: Instituições de Direito Público e Privado   
**University**: Universidade de Brasília - UNB

### Syllabus
Study of fundamental norms and principles of Public and Private Law, with a special dogmatic-panoramic focus on the various branches of Brazilian positive law. The problem of interpretation: norm and legal system. Sources of law. The State and Constitutional Law: fundamental rights and guarantees. Organization of the State and powers.

### Justification
The course aims to offer general notions about Brazilian Law, in order to form critical citizens committed to the Democratic Rule of Law.

### Objective
To understand Brazilian Public and Private Law institutions from a panoramic, interdisciplinary, and critical perspective.
